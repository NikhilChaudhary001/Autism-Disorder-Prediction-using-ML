# Autism-Disorder-Prediction-using-ML

📌 Overview:
This project aims to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) using machine learning algorithms. Autism is a developmental condition that affects communication and behavior, and early detection plays a crucial role in improving treatment and support. The project demonstrates how data preprocessing, visualization, and predictive modeling can be applied to assist in autism screening.

📊 Dataset:
The dataset contains a mix of demographic, behavioral, and screening-related features. Examples include age, gender, family history of autism, and responses to screening test questions. The target variable is a binary classification indicating whether the individual is likely to have autism.

⚙️ Tools and Libraries:
The project is implemented in Python using common data science and machine learning libraries.
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Machine Learning: Scikit-learn

🚀 Project Workflow:
Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and preparing data for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identifying trends, correlations, and patterns through visualizations.
Model Development – Building multiple machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines.
Model Evaluation – Comparing performance based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Insights – Highlighting the most effective model and interpreting key features that influence predictions.
